# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# Team Roles
-Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
-Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
-DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
-QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
-Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
-Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
-PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
-GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
-Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
-Redis: Used for caching and session management.
-Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
-CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

#Database Design
-Users: id, name, email_address, Password, property
-Property: id, name, Rooms, Features
-Payment: id, method, message
-Booking: id, property_id, start_date, duration,end_date

#Feature Breakdown
-User Authentication: Handles registration, authentication and management of user profiles.
-Property Management: Handles the registration of new propertiesand management of existing ones.
-Booking System: Handles the creationa and management of bookings.
- Payment Processing: Ensure secure and transparent transactions.
- Review System: Creation and management of user reviews.

#API Security
1. Authentication

All API routes that handle sensitive operations (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting data) require authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Each user receives a token after logging in, which must be included in the Authorization header for protected endpoints.

Why itâ€™s important:
Authentication ensures that only verified users can access specific resources, preventing unauthorized access and impersonation.

2. Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to manage permissions.
For example, admins can create or delete records, while standard users may only read or update their own data.

Why itâ€™s important:
Authorization enforces boundaries and ensures users can only perform actions that align with their assigned privileges, reducing the risk of misuse or data leaks.

3. Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited using middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Each IP address is limited to a fixed number of requests per minute.

Why itâ€™s important:
Rate limiting helps maintain server performance, prevents brute-force attacks, and ensures fair use of system resources.

#CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that every code change is automatically tested and merged into the main branch without breaking existing functionality.

Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the delivery of updates to production or staging environments once the code passes all tests.

Why CI/CD Is Important

Implementing CI/CD improves the projectâ€™s reliability, speed, and maintainability by:

ðŸš€ Automating Deployments: Reduces manual errors and ensures consistent release processes.

âœ… Ensuring Code Quality: Automatically runs tests, linters, and build checks before deployment.

ðŸ”„ Faster Iterations: Developers can ship new features and fixes quickly and confidently.

ðŸ§© Improving Collaboration: Multiple contributors can safely integrate code changes without disrupting production.

Tools Used

The project can use the following tools to implement CI/CD:

GitHub Actions: Automates build, test, and deployment workflows directly within GitHub.

Docker: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployments.

Render / Vercel / AWS / Railway: Used to host and automatically deploy the backend and frontend upon successful builds.

Prisma Migrate: Automates database migrations during the deployment process.
